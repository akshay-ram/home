			<p> The Sun is a yellow medium-sized star, which holds 99.8% of the mass in the solar system. It provides all energy for us on Earth, and without it we would not survive. The surface of the Sun is around 5,500 degrees Celsius (10,000 degrees Fahrenheit), and scientists at NASA estimate one would need to explode 100 billion tons of dynamite every second to match the energy produced by the Sun. It takes approximately 8 minutes for the light from it to reach us. Nuclear fusion is what keeps the Sun heated, which is a process that involves the mixing of lighter elements like hydrogen and helium, into heavier elements like iron. This fusion releases huge amounts of heat and energy from the core, which eventually exits the Sun at the surface through solar flares, solar wind, and more. </p>
