			<h2> Introduction </h2>
			<p> Space is an interesting topic, and is the most unknown strand of science to this date. The curiosity in humans keep us motivated to explore the far reaches of the Universe, and continue to learn more about the vast expanses of darkness above our heads. This website breifly outlines what we have learned so far in astronomy over the years, and what there is to be learned in the future. So let's get started!</p> 
			<h2> The Solar System </h2>
			<p> The definition of a solar system is the Sun together with all the planets and other bodies that revolve around it. Our solar system consists of eight planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth (our home planet),  Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. And no, PLuto is NOT a planet, as it was demoted to a dwarf planet in 2006 by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). Other objects orbit the Sun as well, like asteroids, comets, space dust, and more. We will learn more about these celestial objects in detail later.

			<h2> The Sun </h2>
			<p> The Sun is a yellow medium-sized star, which holds 99.8% of the mass in the solar system. It provides all energy for us on Earth, and without it we would not survive. The surface of the Sun is around 5,500 degrees Celsius (10,000 degrees Fahrenheit), and scientists at NASA estimate one would need to explode 100 billion tons of dynamite every second to match the energy produced by the Sun. It takes approximately 8 minutes for the light from it to reach us. Nuclear fusion is what keeps the Sun heated, which is a process that involves the mixing of lighter elements like hydrogen and helium, into heavier elements like iron. This fusion releases huge amounts of heat and energy from the core, which eventually exits the Sun at the surface through solar flares, solar wind, and more. </p>
